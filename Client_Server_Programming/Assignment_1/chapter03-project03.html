			<th> Brief Overview </th>
			<td><p> The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's oceans. It is also the most shallow. It's located in the north polar region in the North Hemisphere. </p></td>
			<td><p> The Altantic Ocean is unique in that it separates the Old World from the New World. It lies between Europe and Africa on the east, and the Americas on the west. </p></td>
			<td><p> The Indian Ocean contains roughly 20% of all of Earth's water. As you may have been able to guess, the Indian Ocean is named after India. </p></td>
			<td><p> The Pacific Ocean is larger than all the dry land on Earth's surface combined. It also has the deepest point in the world in it: the Mariana Trench. </p></td>
			<td><p> The Southern Ocean is the opposite of the Arctic Ocean, in the sense that it covers the south polar region in the Southern Hemisphere.Not all countries consider the Southern Ocean an
					actual ocean, however. </p></td>

	<p style = "font-size: 1.5em"> Lastly, I hope you are enjoying oceans as much as I am. But here's a paragraph of precaution: </p>

	<blockquote>
		The oceans require a lot of care from us. For instance, our love of fishing has driven oceans to the point of nearly
		being devoid of life, especially when compared to long ago. It's not just fish getting killed, however, large predators
		are being hunted for their fins. This not only leads to small amounts of predators, but it ruins ecosystems because of
		the shift in the food chain. Another problem is that we are burning so much fossil fuels and putting a crap ton of CO2
		into the atmosphere. The ocean naturally takes in CO2 and thus the more we put into the atmosphere, the more the ocean
		absorbs. As the ocean absorbs more CO2, it becomes more acidic. Making the ocean more acidic isn't our only problem. The
		amount of trash we dump into the ocean is also killing wildlife. This massive killing of wildlife is creating ocean dead
		zones, which are places where no living things remain. This includes coral reefs. Coral reefs are a huge deal when it
		comes to protecting the oceans. This is because coral reefs protect smaller ocean life from larger ocean life, and thus
		protects ecosystems. Curious for more?
